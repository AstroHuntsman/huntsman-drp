# Download astrometry index files.

# The files are named like index-42XX.fits or index-42XX-YY.fits. XX is the “scale”, YY is the “healpix” number. These
# are called the “4200-series” index files.
# Each index file contains a large number of “skymarks” (landmarks for the sky) that allow our solver to identify your
# images. The skymarks contained in each index file have sizes (diameters) within a narrow range. You probably want
# to download index files whose quads are, say, 10% to 100% of the sizes of the images you want to solve.
# For example, let’s say you have some 1-degree square images. You should grab index files that contain skymarks of
# size 0.1 to 1 degree, or 6 to 60 arcminutes. Referring to the table below, you should grab index files 4203 through
# 4209. You might find that the same number of fields solve, and faster, using just one or two of the index files in the
# middle of that range - in our example you might try 4205, 4206 and 4207.
